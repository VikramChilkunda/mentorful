Mentorful is a web app designed in anticpation of the overturn of Affirmative Action. Underrepresented minority enrollment in America’s top universities could drop dramatically during the next college admissions cycle due to the impending decisions of two supreme court cases, SFFA v. Harvard and SFFA v. UNC, which may outlaw race-conscious admissions. Our mission is to prevent a decrease in minority enrollment by providing highly-qualified college applicants in underserved communities with free college assistance, tutoring, 4-year high school course planning, and mentorship to ensure that every student has the same opportunity to attend selective universities and maintain diversity in America’s college campuses. All students who believe they qualify for Mentorful benefits can request mentorship by signing up through our calendar. A select group of students recommended by our mentors and identified as highly-qualified applicants will be able to apply for our specialized mentorship program. Students in this program will receive full access to our college assistance, tutoring, course planning, and personalized career guidance services up until graduation.
